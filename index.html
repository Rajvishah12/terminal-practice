      <h1> cold beverages </h1>
      <p> Cold beverages are very refreshing on warm days. </p>
      <p> In terms of cold beverages you can buy, starbucks has some higher
        quality drinks but Dunkin iced coffee is much cheaper. There isn't one
        that's necessarily better than the other, it really just depends on what
        you want at the moment.</p>

      <p> Juices and smoothies are also commonly preferred choices on cold days.
        As they aren't caffinated and generally contain real fruit ingredients,
        many prefer juices and smoothies as healthier options.</p>
